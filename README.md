AI Poker Agent
===

## üëã Introduction
This is a mandatory project in DM879, Artificial Intelligence. The project explores how to develop a Heads Up Texas Hold'em Poker agent using a genetic approach. We have decided to fork the [MIT Poker Engine](https://github.com/mitpokerbots/engine) because our goal is the AI strategy and not the engine itself.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started
The project can be run using Python 3.10. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official website.

Python packages are specified in `requirements.txt`, and can be installed using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the genetic algorithm:

```bash
python main.py
```

To play an interactive game:

```bash
python3 Game.py
```
