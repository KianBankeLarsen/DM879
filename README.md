The idea behind this implementaion is that we have a Board class which holds all the
relevant information behind a game of Texas Hold'em style Poker. This class keeps track
of all game relevant information, such as which player is next and what legal moves the current
player can make. Then the Turn/Round class can be used to simulate rounds by keeping track of relevant
information for each round as who the blinds are, what bets have been placed and what actions the
other players have done.
